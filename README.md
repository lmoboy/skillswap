skillswap ♻️

# Project Description

Skillswap is a simple app designed to facilitate one-on-one skill exchanges between users. It provides a platform for individuals to connect with others and share their knowledge through live video lessons and messaging. The app operates on a unique, community-driven model: it's completely free, but to maintain access, you must contribute. Each user can receive up to three lessons before they are required to teach a skill to another member of the community.

# Features

    Live Video Feed: Engage in real-time, one-on-one lessons with a live video connection.

    Direct Messaging: Communicate with other users to schedule lessons and clarify details.

    Community-Based Exchange: The app is free to use, promoting a cycle of learning and teaching.

    Fair Access System: A lesson limit encourages users to contribute and share their own skills no matter big or small.
